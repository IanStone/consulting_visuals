# Final Project
This project uses all of the skills we have practiced so far in class and incorporates visuals for your presentation of analytical results. Your team must create one forked copy of this repository, add contributors to that repository, and all commit to the same project.

You will be graded on your ability to collaborate and use git, your use of python coding principles, and the ability to present a clean notebook document that outlines your analysis in markdown cells, shows evidence of your findings through visuals and tables.

Once you have cloned the repository, remember to move your data files from the first consulting_analysis project to this folder. If you no longer have those files, they are still available on Canvas.
